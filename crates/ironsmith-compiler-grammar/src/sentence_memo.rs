//! One parse per span: the sentence rules are memoized for the current card.
//!
//! Recognition is an ordered choice over many line and sentence shapes, and
//! most of those shapes need the effect clause parsed before they can decide
//! whether the line is theirs. Without memoization each candidate parsed that
//! clause again — measured at roughly fifteen sentence-rule calls per distinct
//! span across the corpus — and, worse, a shape that *probed* a span could see
//! a different result from the shape that eventually *kept* it if anything in
//! between was not a pure function of the tokens. Memoizing at the rule makes
//! both problems go away by construction: every distinct span is parsed once,
//! and every caller sees that one parse.
//!
//! The rules are pure functions of their tokens except for one side channel,
//! parse-loss recording, which is observed on a miss and replayed on a hit so
//! the report a caller captures does not depend on cache state.
//!
//! The cache is thread-local and cleared at the document boundary — a card is
//! the unit of recognition — and bounded so a long-lived test thread cannot
//! grow it without limit.
