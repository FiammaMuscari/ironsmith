//! A statement and the riders that bind back to it, as one procedure.
//!
//! "Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn. You
//! gain life equal to the damage prevented this way." is a statement followed
//! by a sentence that refers back to it — here to the prevention event's
//! amount, which only the shield knows. The sentence loop binds such riders to
//! the preceding effect ([`super::chain_carry`]); this module lets every place
//! that asks whether a program covers a run of sentences see the statement and
//! its riders as one, so the pair is neither split into independently parsed
//! sentences nor kept from the segment structure a program gives.
