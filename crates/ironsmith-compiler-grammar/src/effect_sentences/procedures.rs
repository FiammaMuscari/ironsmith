//! A multi-sentence procedure in progress in the sentence loop.
//!
//! The loop parses one sentence at a time. Some sentences bind a group of
//! cards that the next sentences refer to — the cards looked at, the cards a
//! traversal revealed — and those sentences form a procedure: consecutive
//! statements over one group. The loop keeps at most one procedure open; the
//! kinds live in their own modules, and this one only says which is open.
