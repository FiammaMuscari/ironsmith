//!
//! "Look at the top four cards of your library. You may reveal a creature card
//! from among them and put it into your hand. Put the rest on the bottom of
//! your library in a random order." is three statements. The first binds the
//! group of cards looked at; the second selects from that group and binds the
//! selection; the third disposes of what was not selected. Each statement is
//! recognized on its own sentence. What links them is the group an earlier
//! statement bound, which the sentence loop carries between consecutive
//! sentences; a sentence that is none of these statements ends the procedure.
//!
//! The sequence registry used to recognize each such wording as one named
//! program. These statements produce the same effects those programs did, one
//! sentence at a time, so a program the registry no longer names still compiles
//! to the same text. Where two programs spelled the same selection differently
//! depending on what followed it, the selection is read when its sentence
//! arrives and spelled when the remainder does ([`selections`]).
