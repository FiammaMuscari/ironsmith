/// # MTG Rules Context
///
/// Per Rules 611.2c and 611.3a, this distinction matters for determining
/// whether targets are locked at resolution or evaluated dynamically.
///
/// ## Resolution Effects (Rule 611.2c)
///
/// Effects created by resolving spells or abilities have their targets "locked in"
/// at the time they resolve. Even if a filter is part of the effect, it was evaluated
/// once at resolution time.
///
/// ```text
/// Example: "Target creature gets +2/+2 until end of turn"
/// - Target chosen when spell is cast
/// - Effect applies only to that specific creature
/// - If creature leaves battlefield and returns, effect doesn't reapply
/// ```
///
/// ## Static Ability Effects (Rule 611.3a)
///
/// Effects generated by static abilities on permanents apply dynamically.
/// They continuously check their filter and apply to any matching objects.
///
/// ```text
/// Example: "Creatures you control get +1/+1" (Glorious Anthem)
/// - No targets chosen
/// - Effect applies to all creatures you currently control
/// - New creatures you gain control of immediately get the bonus
/// - Creatures that stop being creatures lose the bonus
/// ```
///
/// ## Edge Cases
///
/// Some spells create effects with filters that apply to "all" of something:
/// ```text
/// "Until end of turn, creatures you control get +1/+1"
/// ```
/// Even though this has a filter, it's a Resolution effect - the "creatures you control"
/// was evaluated at resolution time. A creature that enters later won't get the bonus.
