//! Modular static ability system for MTG.
//!
//! This module provides a trait-based architecture for static abilities.
//! Each ability type implements the `StaticAbilityKind` trait, allowing for:
//! - Co-located tests with each ability implementation
//! - Self-contained ability logic
//! - Easy addition of new abilities without modifying central code
//! - Scalable to thousands of unique card abilities
//!
//! # Module Structure
//!
//! ```text
//! static_abilities/
//!   mod.rs              - This file, trait definition and StaticAbility wrapper
//!   id.rs               - StaticAbilityId enum for identity checking
//!   keywords.rs         - Simple keyword abilities (Flying, Trample, etc.)
//!   combat.rs           - Combat modifiers (MustAttack, CantBlock, etc.)
//!   protection.rs       - Protection, Hexproof, Ward, Shroud
//!   continuous.rs       - Effect-generating abilities (Anthem, GrantAbility, etc.)
//!   cost_modifiers.rs   - Cost modification (Affinity, Delve, Convoke, etc.)
//!   restrictions.rs     - Game rule restrictions (PlayersCantGainLife, etc.)
//!   characteristics.rs  - Characteristic-defining abilities
//!   misc.rs             - Other abilities
//! ```
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use ironsmith::static_abilities::{StaticAbility, StaticAbilityId};
//!
//! // Create abilities using convenience constructors
//! let flying = StaticAbility::flying();
//! let anthem = StaticAbility::anthem(filter, 1, 1);
//!
//! // Check ability identity
//! if ability.id() == StaticAbilityId::Flying {
//!     // Handle flying
//! }
//!
//! // Generate continuous effects
//! let effects = ability.generate_effects(source, controller);
//! ```
