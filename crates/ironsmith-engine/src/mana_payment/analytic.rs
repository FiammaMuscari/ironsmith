//! Assignment-based planning for the common mana payment shape.
//!
//! The search in [`super::planner`] clones a whole [`GameState`] for every
//! branch it explores, because activating a mana ability can change the board
//! in ways only simulation can predict. Most payments are not like that: every
//! source taps for a fixed bundle, nothing leaves the battlefield, and the only
//! real question is which sources to tap for which pips. That question is a
//! bipartite assignment, and solving it directly replaces thousands of clones
//! with one per source.
//!
//! Two rules keep this honest:
//!
//! 1. **Bundles are measured, never predicted.** Each candidate activation is
//!    simulated exactly once against the root state, so triggered mana
//!    abilities (CR 605.1b), continuous effects, and replacement effects are
//!    all reflected without this module having to re-derive them.
//! 2. **Failure means "fall back", never "unpayable".** Every exit here returns
//!    `None` and hands the request to the search. A gap in the model can cost
//!    speed; it cannot change which payments are legal.
//!
//! The chosen sequence is replayed against a staged clone and re-checked with
//! the same `can_pay_request` the search uses, so a plan leaving here has been
//! validated by the authoritative predicate, not by this module's arithmetic.
