/// 5. ChoosingX (601.2b) - Announce X value
/// 6. AnnouncingCost (601.2b) - Announce hybrid/Phyrexian mana choices
/// 7. ChoosingTargets (601.2c) - Choose targets
/// 8. ChoosingAssistPlayer / ChoosingAssistContribution / PayingAssistMana
///    (702.132a) - Choose and confirm an assisting player's whole-cost plan
/// 9. ChoosingNextCost - Choose the next remaining cost to pay
/// 10. ProcessingCosts - Pay a selected non-mana cost
/// 11. ChoosingSacrifice / ChoosingCardCost - Resolve object/card cost choices
/// 12. PayingMana (601.2g-h) - Confirm one authoritative activation-and-payment plan
/// 13. ReadyToFinalize (601.2i) - Spell becomes cast
