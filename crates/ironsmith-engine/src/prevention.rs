//! Prevention effect system.
//!
//! Prevention effects are a subset of replacement effects that specifically
//! prevent damage. Per MTG Rule 615, they use "prevent" language.
//!
//! Key rules:
//! - Rule 615.1: Prevention effects are replacement effects
//! - Rule 615.7: "Prevent the next N damage" creates a shield that tracks remaining prevention
//!   and is allocated by the affected player across simultaneous sources
//! - Rule 615.12: Prevention effects still apply once to unpreventable damage, prevent zero,
//!   retain their shields, and perform any additional effects
