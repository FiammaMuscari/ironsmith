//! Choices among cards in a hidden hand in peer (mental-poker) matches.
//!
//! Every peer runs its own engine. The owner of a hidden hand card knows its
//! identity; the other peers hold a "Hidden Card" placeholder with no
//! characteristics. A choice such as "put a creature card from your hand onto
//! the battlefield" therefore sees real matches on the owner and nothing on the
//! other peers. Anything decided from that filter result — whether a prompt
//! exists, its bounds, auto-picking a lone candidate, skipping an empty choice —
//! desyncs the positional decision stream.
//!
//! The rule used here mirrors hidden library searches:
//!
//! * Whether a choice "depends on hidden identity" is judged only from facts
//!   every peer shares: the filter states a quality (CR 701.19b) and the hand
//!   holds cards tracked by the mental-poker layer (`hidden_card_info`, which is
//!   created for every dealt card on every peer and survives the owner's
//!   private opening).
//! * Such a choice is always offered, may be completed partially, and is never
//!   auto-picked or skipped because of the local filter result.
//! * Peers offer placeholders (whose filter result they cannot evaluate) next to
//!   the cards they know match. A chosen placeholder is recorded as an
//!   obligation and checked against the filter once its identity is opened
//!   (the chosen card normally becomes public right away: it moves to a public
//!   zone or is revealed, and the peer front end opens command-referenced cards
//!   before replaying the command, so the choice is validated by the replay
//!   itself). A cheating choice of a non-matching card is rejected either way.
