 *  - `choose`: several ways to play it, so the picker resolves that first;
 *  - `target`: one targeted cast, which hands the mouse to the engine's
 *    targeting arrow as soon as the spell is on the stack;
 *  - `place`: one permanent or land, whose battlefield slot follows the mouse;
 *  - `cast`: nothing left to aim, so cast it and let payment take over.
