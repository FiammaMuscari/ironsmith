/// Effect that searches a player's library for a card.
///
/// The player can choose which matching card to find, or "fail to find" for hidden searches.
/// The library is always shuffled after searching.
///
/// # Fields
///
/// * `filter` - Filter for which cards can be found
/// * `destination` - Where to put the found card
/// * `player` - Whose library to search
/// * `reveal` - Whether the found card must be revealed
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```ignore
/// // Search for a basic land and put it onto the battlefield
/// let effect = SearchLibraryEffect::new(
///     ObjectFilter::basic_land(),
///     Zone::Battlefield,
///     PlayerFilter::You,
///     true,
/// );
///
/// // Tutor effect (search for any card)
/// let effect = SearchLibraryEffect::to_hand(ObjectFilter::default(), PlayerFilter::You, true);
/// ```
