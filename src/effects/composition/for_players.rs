/// # Fields
///
/// * `filter` - Filter for which players to iterate over

///
/// # Example
///
/// ```ignore
/// // Deal 3 damage to each opponent
/// let effect = ForPlayersEffect::new(
///     PlayerFilter::Opponent,
///     vec![Effect::deal_damage(3, ChooseSpec::Player(PlayerFilter::IteratedPlayer))],

/// // Each player draws a card
/// let effect = ForPlayersEffect::new(
///     PlayerFilter::Any,
///     vec![Effect::target_draws(1, PlayerFilter::IteratedPlayer)],
