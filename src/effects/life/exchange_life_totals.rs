/// Effect that exchanges life totals between two players.

/// Used by cards like "Exchange life totals with target player."

/// the other player's life total was.

/// # Fields
///
/// * `player1` - First player in the exchange (usually the controller)
/// * `player2` - Second player in the exchange (usually target opponent)
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```ignore
/// // Exchange life totals with target player
/// let effect = ExchangeLifeTotalsEffect::with_target();
///
/// // Or with a specific opponent
/// let effect = ExchangeLifeTotalsEffect::with_opponent();
/// ```
