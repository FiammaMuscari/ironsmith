/// Effect that sets a player's life total to a specific value.
///
/// This is different from gaining or losing life:
/// - If the new total is higher, the player gains the difference
/// - If the new total is lower, the player loses the difference
/// - Used by cards like "Your life total becomes 10"
///
/// # Fields
///
/// * `amount` - The life total to set (can be fixed or variable)
/// * `player` - Which player's life total changes
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```ignore
/// // Set life total to 10 (like Sorin Markov's ability)
/// let effect = SetLifeTotalEffect {
///     amount: Value::Fixed(10),
///     player: PlayerFilter::Opponent,
/// };
/// ```
