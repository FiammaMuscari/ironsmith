//! Effect system for spells and abilities.
//!
//! Effects are one-shot game actions that occur when a spell or ability resolves.
//! This module defines the vocabulary of effects that can be composed into abilities.
//!
//! ## Effect Results and Outcomes
//!
//! Effects return an `EffectOutcome` when executed, which contains:
//! - An `EffectResult` indicating what happened (success/failure variants)
//! - A `Vec<TriggerEvent>` of events that occurred during execution
//!
//! `EffectResult` variants:
//! - Success variants: `Count(n)`, `Resolved`, `ManaAdded`, `Objects`
//! - Failure variants: `Declined`, `TargetInvalid`, `Prevented`, `Protected`, `Impossible`
//!
//! Effects can be labeled with `EffectId` using `Effect::with_id`, and later effects
//! can reference those results using `Effect::if_` with an `EffectPredicate`.
